# global-git
Because why should English speakers have all the fun?

Finally, you can use Git commands in Spanish without your computer yelling at you. Born out of a side project during test runs and the revolutionary idea: "wait, is that actually possible?"
¿Qué es esto?
git-español is a wrapper that lets you use Git commands in Spanish. That's it. That's the repo.
Want to git cometer instead of git commit? Now you can. Feel like doing a git empujar instead of git push? Go wild.
Installation
bash# TODO: add installation instructions
(we were too busy vibecoding to write this part yet)

## Uso (Usage)
Instead of this:
bashgit commit -m "fix: typo in readme"
git push origin main
Do this:
bashgit cometer -m "arreglo: error en readme"
git empujar origin principal

Why though?
Why not? Also:

- Makes your git history more interesting
- Confuses your coworkers in the best way
- Proves that programming doesn't have to be English-only
- Born from procrastination and "actually down" energy

## Inspiración
Shoutout to git-global for proving this concept works. We're just doing it con sabor.
Contributing
PRs welcome! Especially if you want to add more Spanish commands or make this work with other languages.
No gatekeeping here—whether you're a native speaker or just learning, all contributions are válidas.
License
MIT or whatever. Just don't be weird about it.
Credits
Created during a "matcha time" break by people who were waiting for tests to run and decided to vibe code instead.

## ¿Preguntas? ¿Problemas? ¿Quieres agregar más idiomas? 
Open an issue or PR. We'll probably respond between test runs.
Nota: This is a real project that actually works, not just a meme. Probably. We think. (It will be once we finish it.)
