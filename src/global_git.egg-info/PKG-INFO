# global-git

> Because why should English speakers have all the fun?

Finally, you can use Git commands in Spanish without your computer yelling at you. Born out of a side project during test runs and the revolutionary idea: "wait, is that actually possible?"

## ¿Qué es esto?

git-español is a wrapper that lets you use Git commands in Spanish. That's it. That's the repo.

Want to `git cometer` instead of `git commit`? Now you can. Feel like doing a `git empujar` instead of `git push`? Go wild.

## Installation

Option 1: from source
```bash
pip install .
# or editable
pip install -e .
```

Option 2: from a clone
```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd global-git
pip install .
```

During install, we add your Python scripts directory to your shell PATH (best-effort) so the `git` shim runs before the system git. Set `GLOBAL_GIT_NO_PATH=1` to opt out.

## Uso (Usage)

Instead of this:
```bash
git commit -m "fix: typo in readme"
git push origin main
```

Do this:
```bash
git cometer -m "arreglo: error en readme"
git empujar origin principal
```

## Comandos Disponibles (Available Commands)

**git cometer** → `git commit` - You're committing to your code, Spanish style

**git empujar** → `git push` - Push it real good

**git jalar** → `git pull` - The opposite of empujar, obviously

**git rama** → `git branch` - Branch out, pero en español

**git añadir** → `git add` - Add files with flair

**git clonar** → `git clone` - Same word, different vibe

**git estado** → `git status` - Check your estado

**git fusionar** → `git merge` - Merge conflicts hit different in Spanish

*More commands coming soon™*

### Flags too

Flags are translated when possible:

- `--alluda` → `--help` (because spelling is hard sometimes)
- `--ayuda` → `--help`
- Values like `--color=always` keep their value when translated

You can disable translation for a command by setting `GLOBAL_GIT_BYPASS=1` in the environment.

### User configuration

Add your own mappings in `~/.config/global-git/config.json`:
```json
{
  "commands": { "enviar": "push" },
  "flags": { "--ayudita": "--help" }
}
```
Or set `GLOBAL_GIT_CONFIG=/path/to/config.json` to use a custom file.

## Why though?

Why not? Also:
- Makes your git history more interesting
- Confuses your coworkers in the best way
- Proves that programming doesn't have to be English-only
- Born from procrastination and "actually down" energy

## Contributing

PRs welcome! Especially if you want to add more Spanish commands or make this work with other languages. 

No gatekeeping here—whether you're a native speaker or just learning, all contributions are válidas.

## License

MIT or whatever. Just don't be weird about it.

## Credits

Created during a "matcha time" break by people who were waiting for tests to run and decided to vibe code instead.

*¿Preguntas? ¿Problemas? ¿Quieres agregar más idiomas?* Open an issue or PR. We'll probably respond between test runs.

**Nota:** This is a real project that actually works, not just a meme. Probably. We think. (It will be once we finish it.)
